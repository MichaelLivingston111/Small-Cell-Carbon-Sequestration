# Small-Cell-Carbon-Sequestration

Smaller phytosynthetic cells, or smaller celled phytoplankton, are currently outcompeting their larger celled counter parts throughout the vastness of the worlds oceans. This competetive transitionn has significant implications for biogeochemical cycling, as smaller cells are significantly less efficient at capturing and storing carbon within the ocean.

This repository contains code and data files aimed at quantifying, visualizing and identifying statistical trends in small cell marine carbon uptake. Statistical techniques include multivariate analysis (i.e. Principal Component Analysis, Analysis of Variance) and localized regression modeling. Data was obtained from in-situ 13-C and 15-N labeled isotopic experiments, over a 4-year period.
