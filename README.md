# Small-Cell-Carbon-Sequestration
A repository with code and data files aimed at quantifying, visualizing and identifying statistical trends in small cell marine carbon uptake. Statistical techniques include multivariate analysis (i.e. Principal Component Analysis, Analysis of Variance) and localized regression modelling. Data was obtained from in-situ 13-C and 15-N labeled isotopic experiments, over a 4-year period.
